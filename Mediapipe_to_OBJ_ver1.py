'''ingests a video file and output **478** xyz face landmarks per frame to a csv-type file'''

'''
note: the Face Mesh data contains 468 (0-467) face landmarks as per the published canonical face model,
but also an *additional* 10 xyz coords - these are five per eye (iris), such that
index 468 is the centre of the character's right eye (468-472)
index 473 is the centre of the character's left eye (473-477)
